# Project Ntalk

This is simple project of the book Code House - Node.js

## Built With

* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - Is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

* [EJS](http://www.embeddedjs.com/) - Combines data and a template to produce HTML.

* [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) - Is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.

* [Consign](https://github.com/jarradseers/consign) - Makes applications easier to develop with logical file separation and automatic script loading.

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schemas.

* [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) - Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data.

* [Body Parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) - Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.

* [Express Session](https://github.com/expressjs/session) - User session handling.

* [Method Overrid](https://github.com/expressjs/method-override) - Lets you use HTTP verbs such as PUT or DELETE in places where the client doesn't support it.

* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) - Tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting.

* [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) - The motivation with this module is to provide a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP, while still allowing you to drop down to the lower-level API provided by superagent.
